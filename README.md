# PPO Algorithm (WIP)

Simple ppo implementation adapted to use random network distillation (RND). PyTorch implementation has RND for contienous action spaces with future support for discrete.

### To run PyTorch version:

`cd PPO/Torch`
`python main.py`

### TODO
- [] Seperate PPO and RND
- [] Support Discrete and Contineous Envs
- [] Vectorize PPO
