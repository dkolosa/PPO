# PPO Algorithm (Heavy WIP)

Simple ppo implementation adapted to use random network distillation (RND). PyTorch implementation has RND for contienous action spaces.

Tensorflow version is simple PPO and in WIP and may not work properly (might be removed).

### To run PyTorch version:

`cd PPO/Torch`
`python main.py`

### TODO

- [] Seperate PPO and RND
- [] Support Discrete and Contineous Envs
- [] Implement RND in TF2
- [] Vectorize PPO
